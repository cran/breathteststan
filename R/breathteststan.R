#' @title List of stanmodels
#' @description stanmodel is generated by \code{stanmodels.R} and normally not exported.
#' For easier testing, it is exported here, but this might by a bad idea.
#' Without exporting, access is available via \code{breathteststan:::stanmodels},
#' which is not very nice either.
#' @examples
